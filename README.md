<h1 align="center">Merge Sort</h1>

### Problem Statement

In computer science, Merge Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm. The algorithm works by recursively dividing an array into two halves, sorting each half independently, and then merging the two sorted halves back together. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

Merge Sort begins by splitting the array into the smallest possible subarrays, typically single elements, which are naturally sorted. Then, it repeatedly merges adjacent subarrays, comparing elements and arranging them in order, until the entire array is merged back into a sorted sequence.

The key parameters that define Merge Sort are the array to be sorted and the recursive division and merging process. It performs consistently with a time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the most reliable sorting algorithms, especially for large datasets.

This repository implements Merge Sort in its simplicity: given an array of elements as input, it returns the array in sorted order.

You can read more about this on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).
